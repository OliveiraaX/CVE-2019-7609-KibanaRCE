# CVE-2019-7609-KibanaRCE
Minor changes were made to the CVE to make it compatible with Python 3. cve-modific.py

Here are the modifications: In the get_kibana_version() function, the line match = re.findall(pattern, r.content) was updated to match = re.findall(pattern, r.text). This change was made to use r.text instead of r.content, allowing the response to be treated as a string rather than bytes.
